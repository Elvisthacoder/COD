### CoD  
>Code for a Call of duty game demo.  
####Explanation  
#####In SuperSoldier Class  
>method takeDamage has been overloaded via functionality  
I have added an expression that reduces the level of damage to a supersoldier to half of what an ordinary soldier takes.  
>The console will also display a custom message if the value of hitpoints assigned to a super soldier is less than 3000 and still display the points remaining after damage.  
>I have also added a constructor to the class SuperSoldier to ease assignment of values to soldiers.  
#####In Player class  
>I have added 4 private variables, assigned getter n setter methods to them. Added also 3 constructors.
